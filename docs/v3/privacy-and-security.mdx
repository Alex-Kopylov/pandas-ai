PandaAI provides robust privacy and security features to protect your data and ensure compliance with security requirements.

## Security

The `security` parameter allows for three levels depending on specific use cases: `none`, `standard`, and `advanced.`
This parameter is especially useful when you want to detect malicious intent from user queries and avoid executing code when such intent is found. 
By default, the `security` is set to `standard.` 
The security check might introduce stricter rules that could flag benign queries as potentially harmful. 
You can deactivate them in the configuration by setting `security` to `none.`

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.config.set({
    "security": "none"
})
```

## Custom whitelisted dependencies
By default, PandasAI only allows to run code that uses some whitelisted modules. 
This is to prevent malicious code from being executed on the server or locally. 
However, it is possible to add custom modules to the whitelist. 

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.config.set("custom_whitelisted_dependencies": ["seaborn"])
```

The `custom_whitelisted_dependencies` parameter accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a module. The module must be installed in the environment where PandasAI is running.
Please, make sure you have installed the module in the environment where PandasAI is running. Otherwise, you will get an error when trying to run the code.
